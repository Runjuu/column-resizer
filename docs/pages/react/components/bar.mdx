# Bar

```typescript
import React from "react"

interface ExpandInteractiveArea {
  top?: number;
  left?: number;
  right?: number;
  bottom?: number;
}

interface BarProps extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> {
  size: number;
  expandInteractiveArea?: ExpandInteractiveArea;
  onStatusChanged?: (isActive: boolean) => void;
  onClick?: () => void;
}
```

##### `size`

Required, used to set the size of `Bar`.

##### `expandInteractiveArea`

Used to expand interactive area of `Bar`.

##### `onStatusChanged`

Triggered when the state of `Bar` has changed.

##### `onClick`

Triggered if there's no "move" events. The main difference between it and original `onClick` event is that **there is no parameters** on _this_ `onClick`. You could also use it as a touch event on mobile platform, without 300ms click delay.
