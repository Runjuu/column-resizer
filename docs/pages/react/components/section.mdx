# Section

```typescript
import React from "react"

interface SectionProps extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> {
  size?: number;
  defaultSize?: number;
  maxSize?: number;
  minSize?: number;
  disableResponsive?: boolean;
  onSizeChanged?: (currentSize: number) => void;
}
```

##### `size`

Used to set `Section`'s size. If `size` is set, `Section` will ignore the value of `defaultSize`, `maxSize` and `minSize`.

##### `defaultSize`

Used to set default size of `Section`.

##### `maxSize`

Used to set max size of `Section`.

##### `minSize`

Used to set min size of `Section`.

##### `disableResponsive`

Each `Section` is responsive as default, unless `size` exists. The `responsive` here means that `Section`'s size is related with `Container`'s size, if `Container`'s size turn smaller, the `Section`'s size also turn smaller automatically. Otherwise, changes of `Container` size won't affect the `Section` when `disableResponsive` is `true`.

##### `onSizeChanged`

Will be triggered each time its size has changed.
