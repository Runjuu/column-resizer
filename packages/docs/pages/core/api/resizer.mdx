# Resizer

```typescript
interface Resizer {
  resizeSection: (
    indexOfSection: number,
    config: { toSize: number; preferMoveLeftBar?: boolean },
  ) => void;
  moveBar: (indexOfBar: number, config: { withOffset: number }) => void;
  discard: () => void;
  isSectionResized: (indexOfSection: number) => boolean;
  isBarActivated: (indexOfBar: number) => boolean;
  getSectionSize: (indexOfSection: number) => number | -1;
  getTotalSize: () => number;
}
```

##### `resizeSection`

Used to set size of the nth `Section`.
In multi-column layout, there're several `Bar`s could change the `Section`'s size. Therefore, you could try to use the left side `Bar` to resizing by setting `preferMoveLeftBar`.

##### `moveBar`

Used to move the nth `Bar` to resizing.
If the value of A is negative, move `Bar` to the left. When [`vertical`](#vertical) is `true`, move up.

##### `discard`

Discard resizing at this time.

##### `isSectionResized`

Used to determine whether the nth `Section`'s size is changed at current [resizing section](#user-content-resizing-section) or not.

##### `isBarActivated`

Used to determine whether the nth `Bar` is active or not.

##### `getSectionSize`

Used to get size of the nth `Section`. if there is no nth `Section`, return `-1`.

##### `getTotalSize`

Used to get total size of all `Section`.
